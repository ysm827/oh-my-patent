## Design and planning references

Current specifications live in repository-root [`specs/`](../specs/), including
the [review remediation specification and verification ledger](../specs/001-review-remediation/).
The [constitution](../CONSTITUTION.md) defines this convention.
`docs/specs/` is a frozen v0.1.0 snapshot; do not add new specifications there.

These documents retain product design context and plans. They are not, by themselves,
a list of shipped features. Use the guides above and their linked source code for
current behavior. Some design references are in Chinese.

- [Specification index](./specs/README.md): [product requirements](./specs/PRD.md),
  [technical design](./specs/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md), and [API design](./specs/API-DESIGN.md).
- Retrieval improvements: [requirements](./RETRIEVAL_PRD.md), [specification](./RETRIEVAL_SPEC.md),
  and [development plan](./RETRIEVAL_DEV_PLAN.md).
- [Progress-output design](./specs/PROGRESS-OUTPUT-ENHANCEMENT.md).

Keep the workflow reference's Mermaid diagram aligned with the implementation;
`images/` retains other diagram assets. Update both languages when behavior changes.
Avoid manually maintained version labels or passing-test counts in documentation entry points.
