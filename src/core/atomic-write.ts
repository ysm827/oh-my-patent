/**
 * Atomic file writes — the single implementation.
 *
 * Before REQ-016 there were two divergent strategies: `path-persistence.ts`
 * wrote directly with `fs.writeFile` (a crash mid-write leaves a truncated
 * JSON file behind), and `state-manager.ts` used temp file + `unlinkSync`
 * target + `renameSync`. The unlink creates a window — milliseconds during
 * which the target does not exist — and on Windows a crash inside that window
 * loses the file entirely.
 *
 * The strategy here is temp file + `rename` over the target, with no unlink:
 * POSIX rename replaces atomically, and on Windows libuv's implementation uses
 * MoveFileEx with MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING, so the target is either the old
 * file or the new file, never absent and never half-written.
 *
 * The `rename` implementation is injectable purely so tests can simulate a
 * crash between "temp written" and "rename applied".
